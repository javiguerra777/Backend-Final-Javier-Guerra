This is a backend rest API for a user and their products at this store. I used MYSQL
tested routes using insomnia, if there are any errors please let me know so I can fix them
I was able to fix the issue with the bcrypt.compare and the backend works a lot better now
I hid my keys, but to run this project you must have node installed on your computer
I recommend installing Nodemon so to do that just run this command:
npm i nodemon and you can also look into installing nodemon globally
run nodemon app and this app works
Also I recommend testing your routes with postman or insomnia
